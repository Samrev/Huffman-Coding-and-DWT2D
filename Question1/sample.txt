hi.
we are rohan and ayush from mathematics and computing.
this is the sample text file for the question one of the assignment one.
just to be sure i will enlist all the alphabets in the following line.
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.
we will encode this file and then decode it to show that huffman is a lossless technique used for data compression.
we have put good amount of efforts in this assignment and expect to obtain good grades.
thank you.
